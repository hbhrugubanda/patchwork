## Hapi server and a Cassandra database

This is a very vague sketch for an application using Hapi and Cassandra. The idea is to develop this into an API to be used by a Front-end application.

### To get setup:
1. Install `yarn`
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run docker-compose up to start the Cassandra docker image
4. Run yarn start to start the hapi server
